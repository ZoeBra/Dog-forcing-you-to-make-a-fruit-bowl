# Dog-forcing-you-to-make-a-fruit-bowl

Description:
My Scratch project involves a dog asking for your name and inviting you to get fruit.
The dog will walk away and then reappear in a new backdrop.
The dog will then instruct you to put the fruit in the bowl, which will transform into a fruit bowl. 
Unfortunately, the fruit and bowl sometimes do not hide when resetting the game due to bad code. 
 I've tried to fix it, though, with no change.
